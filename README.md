This project aims to forecast customer purchasing behavior by analysing demographic and review-related data, with an emphasis on Micro-Numerosity analysis to evaluate the effects of small-scale numerical factors on purchasing predictions.


## üìä Project Overview:
The Customer Purchase Prediction & Micro-Numerosity Analysis project aims to forecast customer purchasing behavior by analyzing demographic and review-related data. It places a strong emphasis on Micro-Numerosity analysis to evaluate the effects of small-scale numerical factors on purchasing predictions. This analysis helps businesses improve marketing strategies by understanding and predicting customer purchase intentions more accurately.

## üìÑ Abstract:
This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer purchase behavior by analyzing demographic and review data. It explores how Micro-Numerosity influences prediction accuracy, with model performance evaluated through metrics like *accuracy, **confusion matrix, **ROC curve, and **AUC. Insights from feature importance and model confidence are provided, with future improvements planned through *hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.

## üìå Problem Statement:
The project aims to predict customer purchasing behavior using demographic and review-related data, focusing on the impact of small-scale numerical features (Micro-Numerosity) on prediction accuracy.

# üìäDataset overview:
   
    1.Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
    
    2.Age: The age of the customer.
    
    3.Gender: The gender of the customer.
    
    4.Education: The highest level of education attained by the customer (e.g., School, UG, PG).
    
    5.Review: A categorical rating of the customer‚Äôs review (e.g., Average, Poor, Good).
    
    6.Purchased: Whether the customer made a purchase (Yes/No).
    
    This dataset can be used to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on demographic and review data, with the target variable being the Purchased column. You would need to encode categorical features such as Gender, Education, and Review before applying machine learning algorithms.

## üìÇ Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting customer purchase behavior using machine learning models and analysing the influence of small-scale numerical features through **Micro-Numerosity Analysis**. By leveraging a Random Forest Classifier, we aim to provide insights into what factors drive customer purchases based on demographic and review-related features. This analysis has practical implications for businesses seeking to understand and predict consumer behavior more accurately.

# *Process Overview*:

1. **Data Import & Exploration**
   - Imported relevant libraries and loaded the customer data.
   - Conducted a preliminary exploration to familiarize with data structure and characteristics.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Defined target (`y`) and feature variables (`X`).
   - Encoded categorical variables to prepare for modelling.

3. **Train-Test Split**
   - Divided the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.

4. **Model Training & Selection**
   - Selected a Random Forest Classifier for the prediction task.
   - Trained the model using the training data subset.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Predicted outcomes on the test set with the trained model.
   - Assessed model performance through a confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.

6. **Feature Importance Analysis**
   - Visualized feature importance using a bar chart.
   - Identified the primary factors affecting purchase predictions.

7. **Confusion Matrix Heatmap**
   - Generated a heatmap of the confusion matrix to illustrate model performance.
   - Analysed instances of true/false positives and negatives.

8. **ROC Curve & AUC**
   - Computed and plotted the ROC curve and AUC to evaluate model discriminatory ability.
   - Examined the balance between true positive and false positive rates.

9. **Probability Distribution Analysis**
   - Reviewed the distribution of probabilities for the positive ('Yes') class predictions.
   - Assessed model confidence in its purchase predictions.



# üìå Key Dataset Features:
- **Customer Demographics**: Information about the customer‚Äôs age, gender, location, etc.

- **Customer Reviews**: Feedback or ratings given by customers.

- **Purchase Indicator**: Whether a customer made a purchase (target variable).


## üîç Project Workflow:

- ###  Data Import and Exploration
  - **Imported necessary libraries** such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
  - **Loaded and explored the dataset** to understand the key variables and identify any missing or inconsistent data.

- ### Data Preprocessing
  - **Target Variable (y)**: Defined the purchase status as the target for prediction.
  - **Feature Variables (X)**: Selected relevant demographic and review-based features for model training.
  - **Categorical Encoding**: Applied label encoding or one-hot encoding to transform categorical features for model compatibility.
  - **Data Normalization**: Scaled features to ensure uniformity across all variables.

- ###  Train-Test Split
  - **80-20 split**: Divided the data into 80% for training the model and 20% for testing its performance.
  - Ensured that both sets maintained a balanced distribution of the target variable.

- ###  Model Selection and Training
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: Selected as the machine learning model for its robustness and ability to handle feature importance.
  - Trained the model on the training dataset, adjusting hyperparameters where necessary to optimize performance.

  - **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Illustrated true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives using a heatmap to visualize model performance across different prediction categories.

- ###  Feature Importance Visualization
  - Plotted a **bar chart** to visualize the importance of each feature in predicting purchases.
  - Identified key factors that have a significant impact on customer purchase decisions, such as demographic attributes and review scores.

- ###  ROC Curve and AUC Score
  - Generated the **ROC curve** to evaluate the trade-offs between sensitivity (True Positive Rate) and specificity (False Positive Rate).
  - Calculated the **AUC (Area Under the Curve)** score to quantify the model‚Äôs ability to distinguish between classes.

- ###  Distribution of Predicted Probabilities
  - Analysed the **distribution of predicted probabilities** for positive class (customers predicted to make a purchase).
  - This analysis helped us understand the model‚Äôs confidence in its predictions and identify areas for potential improvement.
